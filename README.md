# Netflix-Project


## :book: Discription

In these projects, I’ll apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. Using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.

###Dataset:

* This Netflix Dataset has information about the TV shows and Movies available on Netflix till 2021.
